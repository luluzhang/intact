<h1>Linear Static Analysis</h1>
<p>Structural analysis aims to predict deformation and stresses in a body (or collection of bodies) 
that is restrained from moving and is subjected to external forces (loads).  Different theoretical 
models of structural analysis have been developed to simulate a variety of realistic physical 
behaviors and phenomena.  The simplest and the most widely used type of structural analysis is 
linear static analysis, based on theory of lineary elasticity.</p>
<p>Like all numerical simulations methods, Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; numerically approximates this 
idealized model of linear elasticity within some limited precision.  As such, Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; 
can provide insight into structural properties of solid shapes and help in choosing the best 
available alternative. However, numerical simulation of an idealized mathematical model is not a 
substitute for physical testing and should not be relied upon for critical design decisions.</p>
