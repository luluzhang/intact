<h1>Linear Static Analysis</h1></a>
<h2>Physical Reality</h2>
<p>It is important to remember that Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; computes a numerical approximation of an 
idealized theoretical model, not physical reality.  Every model has its limitations. For example, 
the linear theory of elasticity predicts infinite stresses near "wedges", re-entrant corners, 
interfaces between different materials, and so on.  In physical reality, this cannot happen, because 
the material simply deforms more "plastically" (as opposed to "elastically").  But in the computer 
simulation, this means that at some points in your model, stresses will never converge – they will 
just get bigger and bigger as you increase the resolution.  The more complex your model is, the more 
likely you will have some points like that.</p>
<p>More generally, the linear static model of elasticity (and hence Scan&amp;Solve&#8482;) does not 
account for many important physical phenomena, including vibration, buckling, material and geometry 
non-linearities, large and plastic deformations, and so on.</p>
