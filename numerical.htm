<h2>Scan&Solve Numerical Model</h2>
<p>Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; is a generalized form of the classical Finite Element Analysis (FEA). 
Classical FEA approximates an idealized theoretical model of physical behavior by breaking up the 
model or space into small pieces called finite elements. But Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; was developed 
specifically to liberate FEA from the tyranny of meshing, while preserving most of the advantages 
of this classical and widely accepted method of engineering analysis. The basic idea is simple: 
create separate geometric and physical representations of the model in question and combine them 
only when necessary, without requiring expensive and error-prone data conversions and always using 
the most authentic representation available. The concept is illustrated below.</p>

<p>The analysis model is constructed on a (typically, but not necessarily) uniform orthogonal grid 
of space that initially knows nothing about the model being analyzed. It can be thought of as a 3D 
"graph paper". The usual variety of basis functions may be associated with the vertices of this 
mesh. Currently, only linear B-spline functions are released. The geometric model exists in the 
same space, in its native unaltered form, and is not aware of the mesh surrounding it. The usual 
FEA procedure is then modified at run time to account for the existence of the geometric 
boundaries, restraints, and loads via the Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; process that eliminates or modifies 
the relevant finite elements. From the user perspective, the whole process is totally transparent 
and mesh-free, or more accurately "meshing-free".</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.scan-and-solve.com/page/compare-with-fea">comparison of the 
classical mesh-based FEA and Scan&amp;Solve&#8482;</a> technology. If you want to know more 
technical details about the Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; technology, you can find them in this
