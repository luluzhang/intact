<h2>Resolution and Convergence</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Resolution</em> is the maximum number of finite elements used to compute an approximate 
  solution of the stress analysis problem. Only those elements that intersect the solid are included 
  in the count. Generally speaking, higher resolution increases accuracy of the solution but also 
  requires more memory and longer computation times. In the context of stress analysis, increased 
  resolution should make the system more flexible, generally increasing the computed displacements.</li>
  <li>So why not just always use the maximum resolution? There are at least two important reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>You may run out of memory and/or will have to wait for a long time to get your solution, 
      which will still only be a numerical approximation of an idealized model of physical reality.</li>
      <li>To see if the solution is converging, you need to compare the solutions at several 
      different resolutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Convergence</em> is a key concept in understanding and interpreting the solutions computed 
  by any numerical approximation software. Numerical simulation approximates an idealized theoretical 
  model by breaking it, or the space around it, into small pieces called finite elements. In principle, 
  as elements get smaller and smaller (increasing their number and resolution), the numerical 
  simulation should get closer and closer to the theoretically exact answer. At some point, the 
  simulation gets so close to the exact answer that increasing resolution does not visibly improve 
  the results. In technical jargon, we say that the numerical solution has "converged".  In this 
  sense, there are no "correct" solutions, but only converged solutions.</li>
  <li>To establish that the solution converged, solve the same problem a number of times, gradually 
  increasing the resolution, until displacement values stay approximately in the same range. If 
  displacement does not converge, there is no guarantee that the numerical solution is accurate.</li>
  <li>If computed displacement values did converge, one can also study convergence of stresses. But 
  it is important to remember that the linear theory of elasticity (used by every structural analysis 
  software, including the present version of Scan&amp;Solve&#8482;) predicts infinite stresses near 
  "wedges," re-entrant corners, interfaces between different materials, and and other 
  <em>singularities</em>. In physical reality, this cannot happen, because the material simply 
  deforms more "plastically" (as opposed to "elastically"). This means that at some points in a 
  model, stresses may never converge – they will just get bigger and bigger as you increase the 
  resolution. The more complex your model is, the more likely you will have some singularities like 
  that. It does make sense to study convergence of stress values at particular locations in the 
  model that are away from singularities. <br />
    </li>
  <li>The solution of the problem may not always converge, even for displacement. There are several 
  reasons for this. 
    <ul>
      <li>There may not be enough resolution, even at the maximum resolution allowed by Scan&amp;Solve&#8482;.  
      This is particularly common for models with small features and large size to scale ratio. See 
      section on <a href="known.htm">limitations</a> for more details.</li>
      <li>The model is physically unstable, and small changes in the geometry, material, or boundary 
      conditions lead to large changes in displacements and/or stresses. Numerical approximation 
      may simulate such small changes during the solution process.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Are converged solutions always correct? No. Every numerical procedure has its limitations, 
  and Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; is no exception. The correctness of computed results depends on specific 
  elements used in the solution procedure and individual steps in the procedure process, including 
  function and solid sampling, surface and volume integration, solution of linear system of 
  equations. To validate the solution procedure, it is highly advisable to test it against a variety 
  of similar and different problems and on problems with known solutions.</li>
  </ul>
