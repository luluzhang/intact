<h2>Surface Loads</h2>
<p>Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; currently supports 4 types of surface loads: Vector Force, Scalar Force, 
Pressure, and Torque. Surface loads are applied to faces selected after clicking the [Add] (load)
button in the Specify tab.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> Loads are associated with solid faces by the order the faces are 
represented in Rhino. Consequently, any modifications to the geometry (e.g. Boolean operations) 
that affect the ordering of the faces may result in loads being moved to new faces or lost 
altogether.  Check the location of your loads carefully if you modify the geometry between 
analysis runs.</p>

<h3>Per Face Option</h3>
<p>The "Per Face" option is available when specifying Vector and Scalar forces. Selecting
this option means that the force is duplicated on each face in the set of selected faces. 
Otherwise, the specified force is distributed among the selected faces in proportion to their areas. </p>

<h3>Unit Systems</h3>
<p>The "Unit Sytem" menu is used to switch between different unit configurations when specifying
magnitudes. There are several options available for both metric and U.S. units.</p>

<h3>Vector Force</h3>
<p>A "Vector Force" load is a force load applied to a face in a specified direction. 
This type of load is analogous to pressing on the top of a book to push it across a table.  The 
force is specified by entering the components of the force in each coordinate direction.  If 
multiple faces are selected, check the "Per Face" option to duplicate the force on each face.  
Vector loads are annotated with red arrows in the direction the force is applied.</p>

<p>Another way to specify the vector force is to enter a direction and magnitude. This is done by
selecting the "Vector force Direction & Magnitude" option. After pressing the "Direction" button,
draw the tail, then the head of the vector. The magnitude of the vector is then entered in the 
corresponding text box.</p>

<h3>Scalar Force</h3>
<p>A "Scalar force" load is a load specified in terms of the total force to be applied 
over a face.  This type of load is akin to pushing on a facet of a soccer ball; where the amount 
of force may be known, but the direction might only be described as "inward".  Positive loads push 
into the surface, negative loads pull on the surface.  If multiple faces are selected, check the 
"Per Face" option to duplicate the force on each face. Scalar loads are annotated 
with yellow arrows in the direction of the applied load.</p>

<h3>Pressure</h3>
<p>A "Pressure" load is a load specified in terms of force per unit area.  Positive 
pressures push into the surface, negative pressure pull.  Pressure loads are annotated with blue 
arrows in the direction of the applied pressure.  Examples of pressure loads include wind on the 
side of a building or the air pressure keeping a soccer ball inflated.</p>

<h3>Torque</h3>
<p>A "Torque" load is a load that applies a twisting force around an axis.  Torques are specified
using a 2 step process.  1: The axis (a ray) is chosen by specifying an origin for the axis
followed by a point on the axis (the ray's direction).  2: The magnitude of torque is specified in 
the entry box.  The direction of the torque is determined using the right hand rule: 
using your right hand, point your thumb in the direction of the axis.  A positive torque value 
applies a torque acting in the direction the fingers of your right hand would wrap around the axis. 
The torque load is distributed among all the selected faces and varies linearly from zero at the 
axis.</p>
