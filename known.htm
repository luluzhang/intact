<h1>Linear Static Analysis</h1></a>
<h2>Known Limitations &amp; Common Problems</h2>
<p>Scan&amp;Solve computes a <a href="mathematical.htm">numerical approximation</a> of a mathematical 
model of <a href="mathematical.htm">linear elasticity</a>. As is the case with all such software, 
the computed stresses and displacements should not be confused with <a href="physical.htm">physical 
reality</a> and should not used for critical design decisions in place of physical experients. A 
number of factors, briefly described below, can cause Scan&amp;Solve answers to deviate 
significantly from physical reality:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Model is not linear elastic.</strong>
  A linear elastic model of stress is not applicable in many situations, e.g. non-linear material 
  properties, large plastic deformations, vibrations, buckling, thermal stresses, and so on.</li>
  <li><strong>Idealized geometry and material properties.</strong>
  While geometric inaccuracies may be quantified by design and manufacturing tolerances, predicting 
  the effect of material variability is usually more difficult.</li>
  <li><strong>Imprecise or unrealistic boundary conditions.</strong>
  The correctness of the model depends critically on the type (are they really static?) and 
  accuracy of restraints and loads.  But these parameters are rarely known precisely, contributing 
  to uncertainty of the computed results.</li>
  <li><strong>Low resolution.</strong>
  Every known stress analysis approach (including Scan&amp;Solve) relies on spatial discretization 
  of the geometry in one way or another.  Scan&amp;Solve is unique because it uses volumetric 
  discretization of space that does not conform to geometry, and the user does not need to deal 
  with meshing, but fundamentally, it still relies on the notion of a "finite element" which is 
  associated with some volumetric portion of geometry.  It is usually impossible to estimate a 
  priori how many elements are sufficient for accurate answers. Scan&amp;Solve currently does not 
  perform any posteriori analysis of the computed solutions for accuracy or convergence.</li>
  <li><strong>Missed small features.</strong>
  Scan&amp;Solve tolerates small imperfections and features in the noisy or overly detailed 
  boundary representation of a solid.  However, this means that at low resolution, it could also 
  miss some important features, such as small holes, gaps, and channels that could affect accuracy 
  or correctness of computed solutions.</li>
  <li><strong>Large size to scale ratio.</strong>
  The size to scale ratio is a fundamental barrier of all numerical  methods, and not a limitation 
  unique to Scan&amp;Solve. Challenging models include thin-walled solids, slender truss-like 
  structures, solids restrained on very small faces, and other models where the ratio of the 
  overall size of the solid to the smallest dimension ('scale') on the object is very large.  
  Accurate analysis requires that the size of finite element should be small enough to resolve the 
  smallest scale of the mode.  But if the model is also very large, this will result in a huge number 
  of elements, easily exceeding the maximum resolution available in Scan&amp;Solve.</li>
  <li><strong>No adaptive analysis.</strong>
  Some of the above problem may be alleviated by varying the size of the elements throughout the 
  space, depending on the size of small features and/or desired resolution.  The current version of 
  Scan&amp;Solve does not support such adaptive analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>No edge or point restraints.</strong>
  Only surface areas can be restrained in the current version of Scan&amp;Solve, as dictated by the 
  theory. Point and edge restraints are commonly used in mesh-based FEA packages where they are 
  applied to nodes. But such restraints are actually not physical and may result in poor solutions 
  in vicinity of the restraints.  Scan&amp;Solve may nevertheless offer such restraints in the 
  future in order to support modeling needs of advanced users, with appropriate warning about their 
  utility.</li>
  <li><strong>First degree numerical approximation.</strong>
  The current version of Scan&amp;Solve relies on first degree (linear) polynomial functions 
  (splines) to approximate the solution. Some structural analysis problems require higher-degree 
  functions to achieve accuracy and convergence. We expect future versions of Scan&amp;Solve to 
  support such functions.</li>
</ul>
