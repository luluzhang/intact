<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p> Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; requires a functional Windows installation of Rhino, V4 SR8, or later. Only 32-bit versions of Rhino are supported at this time. Currently there is no support for Rhino on Macintosh systems.    An evaluation copy of Rhino may be downloaded <a href="http://www.rhino3d.com/download.htm"><strong>here</strong></a>. (This fully functional version is the same as the commercial version except that it only saves 25 times. Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; will operate within Rhino during this evaluation period.) </p>
<p>Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; is a computationally intensive application requiring large amounts of memory and computer processing power. At the very minimum,  2GB memory and Pentium 4 processor running Windows-XP installation are expected, but significantly more memory and latest processers running Windows 7 are strongly recommended. </p>
