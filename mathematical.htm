<h1>Linear Static Analysis</h1></a>
<h2>Mathematical Model: Linear Elasticity</h2>
<p>Scan&amp;Solve&#8482; simulates linear static behavior of 3D solids based on mathematical theory of linear elasticity 
which approximates physical reality in many common situations.  Like all mathematical models, linear elasticity 
idealizes physical reality, making a number of simplifying assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Static</strong>: This assumption neglects all dynamic (time-varying) forces and amounts to assuming that 
all loads are increased slowly to the specified magnitudes, and then remain constant.</p>
<p><strong>Elastic</strong>: No permanent deformation takes place, and the body returns to its original shape if the 
loads are removed.</p>
<p><strong>Linearity</strong>: Model deformations (displacements) are linearly proportional to applied loads (forces).  
For example, doubling the magnitude of the force will double the magnitude of the resulting deformations.</p>
<p>Linear static analysis predicts the magnitude of stresses and elastic displacements within the body. In locations 
where the magnitude of stresses exceed certain levels, linear static analysis predicts material failure based on several 
experimentally verified <a href="standard.htm">failure criteria</a>. The type of failure depends on the type of material 
and the stress levels; linear static analysis cannot predict whether failure results in large permanent deformation, 
cracks, or breakage, but only that the stresses and displacements will exceed the elastic limit of the material.</p>
